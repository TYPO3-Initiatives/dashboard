# Dashboard for TYPO3 CMS
This repository was used as a proof-of-concept for the new
Dashboard for TYPO3. With the release of TYPO3 v10.3, the
dashboard is available in core. Therefor, this extension is
abandoned. If you want to use the Dashboard for TYPO3, please
use the TYPO3 core extension called `typo3/cms-dashboard`.

## Which TYPO3 version?
The Dashboard for TYPO3 is merged in core and is only available
in TYPO3 v10.3+. As new core features are used in the dashboard,
we are not able to maintain the extension for TYPO3 v9 as well. 
So if you want to use that new Dashboard, please upgrade to v10.
You will get a lot of great other features as well for developers,
integrators and users.

## But I used this extension in a client project!
As told before, this extension was a proof of concept and was not
meant for production systems. The integration in core does not differ
that much from the proof of concept though, so you should be able to
use the core extension and do some small alterations to your own
widgets.

## Where to find more information?
Currently we are writing documentation for the new dashboard. Meanwhile
there is a small introduction in the feature which can be found on
https://docs.typo3.org/c/typo3/cms-core/master/en-us/Changelog/10.3/Feature-90333-Dashboard.html

## Have a widget request? / Found a bug?
To do feature requests or report bugs, you can use https://forge.typo3.org.
After a login you are able to create a new issue. Please assign the category
dashboard to it, and we will have a look at it as soon as possible!
