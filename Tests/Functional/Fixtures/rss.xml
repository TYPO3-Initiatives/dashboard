						<title>Call for budget application ideas - TYPO3 Association Budget 2020</title>
						<link>https://typo3.org/article/call-for-budget-application-ideas-typo3-association-budget-2020/</link>
						<description>The TYPO3 Association Board presents the available funds and asks the TYPO3 community to submit their ideas for the 2020 TYPO3 Association budget.</description>
						<enclosure url="https://typo3.org/fileadmin/t3o_common_storage/images/stock_photos/pexels/brett-denken-handgeschrieben-6375.jpg" length="4494260" type="image/jpeg" />
						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Total Funds available for 2020</h3>
<p>In coordination with the Treasurer of the TYPO3 Association, the TYPO3 Association Board is releasing the available budget sum for 2020. By releasing the budget amount earlier than in previous years we want to increase transparency, put the application process in a realistic context and encourage applicants to apply for&nbsp;the funds available.</p>
<p><em>Total Funds available for 2020: €900,000</em></p>
<p>Please consider this amount a forecast - it may change according to the actual financial situation.</p>
<h3>Distribution of Funds</h3>
<p>As explained earlier, the funds will be distributed among 3 pools:</p>
<h4>Innovation, Education and Events Pool</h4>
<p><em>Budgeted amount: €250,000</em></p>
<p>For this pool, we have a transparent&nbsp;two-step application process. The first step is for the&nbsp;TYPO3 community members to submit their ideas&nbsp;via the short&nbsp;form below. We have made the process so simple that it should not take an applicant longer than 15 minutes to contribute their idea.</p>
<p><strong>Ideas can be submitted from now until 28th October 2019:</strong><br /> <a href="/project/association/funding-finances/budget-application/" title="Submit your idea now" class="btn btn-secondary">Submit your budget application idea</a></p>
<p>For the second step, the ideas will be put forward for rating in the Association member poll before&nbsp;a final strategic selection is made&nbsp;by the EAB. The selected ideas will be eligible for a budget application submission.</p>
<h3>Development Pool</h3>
<p><em>Budgeted amount: €350,000 (according to GA 2016 and 2017)</em></p>
<p>This pool is available for the TYPO3 core team to fund development and product marketing initiatives. It is managed on behalf of the core team by TYPO3 GmbH. Applications for funding need to be submitted to <a href="https://typo3.com/" target="_blank">TYPO3 GmbH</a>.</p>
<p>TYPO3 GmbH is responsible for the management of this budget via their own accountability structure.&nbsp;By making this budget pool available, the TYPO3 Association remains the largest single funder of the initiatives of the TYPO3 core team and thus contributes heavily to the further development of the TYPO3 CMS product.</p>
<h3>Infrastructure Pool</h3>
<p><em>Budgeted amount: €300,000</em></p>
<p>This pool is available for&nbsp;the TYPO3 Association board to fund operational and infrastructure work. It includes budget positions for contracts with vendors and regular service providers (e.g. data center for hosting, legal assistance), coverage of travel expenses and work time expenses for maintenance costs. New for 2018 will be that all travel expenses from the infrastructure pool will be paid out of a central pot that is&nbsp;the responsibility of the Association president. The advantage of this is that&nbsp;travel costs can be streamlined and leftover budget identified more easily throughout the year.</p>
<p>There is one combined budget application for this infrastructure pool.</p>
<h2>Member Involvement</h2>
<p>The members of the TYPO3 Association stay involved in the budget process. The following opportunities exist to contribute and give feedback:</p>
<h3>Member Poll</h3>
<p>In November, the TYPO3 Association Board will ask its members to rate the ideas submitted to the Innovation, Education and Events Pool and to give feedback to the distribution of funds in the other two pools. The TYPO3 Association Board will take the results of the member poll into consideration for the finalization of the 2020 Association budget and strategy.</p>
<h3>Submission of Ideas</h3>
<p>The submission of ideas to the Innovation, Education and Events pool is open to everyone and we would like to encourage the TYPO3 Association members to play an active role here. We have a larger budget amount available than in earlier years for strategic positioning of TYPO3, and this is a unique chance to contribute.</p>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<p>The TYPO3 Association Board remains available by email to answer your questions and will publish a consolidated FAQ should the need arise.</p>
<p>Contact the TYPO3 Association Board: <a href="javascript:linkTo_UnCryptMailto('nbjmup+cvehfuAuzqp4\/psh');">budget(at)typo3.org</a></p>
<h2>Contribute to the Budget Committee</h2>
<p>We are looking for people, who want to contribute to our Budget Committee. It is&nbsp;responsible for the whole budget process (initiate, evaluate ideas, check budgets during the year.). The committee is lead by one member of the Board of the TYPO3 Assocation.</p>
<p class="alert alert-info"><strong>Any member who likes to be part of the committee can apply via mail <a href="javascript:linkTo_UnCryptMailto('nbjmup+cvehfuAuzqp4\/psh');">budget(at)typo3.org</a>.</strong></p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The budget process for the 2020 Association budget is now launched. We are looking forward to receiving your ideas and feedback.</p>]]></content:encoded>

						<title>Bringing Teams Together at the Combined TYPO3 Sprint</title>
						<link>https://typo3.org/article/bringing-teams-together-at-the-combined-typo3-sprint/</link>
						<description>TYPO3 is about collaboration and community. A very special part of the community experience is when you not only work in your own team but also work together with other teams and exchange ideas. During the Combined Sprint in August 2019 in Freiburg, the Server Team, Documentation Team, and Design Team met to bring TYPO3 forward together.
</description>
						<enclosure url="https://typo3.org/fileadmin/t3o_common_storage/news/2019/09/header_combined_sprint_e.jpg" length="302249" type="image/jpeg" />
						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over three days, we coded, wrote and designed together. The participants included an exciting mix of experienced sprinters and some who were on their very first sprint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What was it all about?</p>
<h2><strong>A Report from the Design Team</strong></h2>
<p>For a successful sprint, you can decide in advance what tasks you will work on. Which will benefit the most from getting people together to collaborate? As we usually do, the Design Team brought a number of tasks that had been open during the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among them were smaller tasks, like a new background for the Association videos, an update of the TYPO3 Styleguide, as well as the processing of the web templates for the TYPO3 websites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first example of the benefits of cross-team sprints when the Server Team could spontaneously provide a repository for the new <a href="https://typo3.org/project/brand/style-guide/" target="_blank">TYPO3 Webstyleguide.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>In addition to this work, the Design Team was also given the task of making the templates as easy as possible to edit in order to give the community members in the various countries the option to print their own material for their user groups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, we created some “general” TYPO3 Rollups for people to use. Roll-ups are portable marketing displays popular at events. <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nDIzg9maXjqG2x-gqgIrNxkfnsTU8h48" target="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nDIzg9maXjqG2x-gqgIrNxkfnsTU8h48">Check out the designs on Google Drive</a>.</p>
<p>So If you want to see our results <a href="https://typo3.org/project/brand/style-guide/" target="_blank">go here for Assets and the new Styleguide</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>A Report from the Server Team</strong></h2>
<p>We attended the combined sprint with three team members: Andreas Beutel, Andri Steiner, Michael Stucki. Andri and Michael worked through the configuration of the typo3.org proxy servers and restored the Chef configuration to ensure all host are using the same setup and configuration. They also updated the Nginx DoS configuration that has been implemented on our infrastructure in the last sprint.</p>
<p>Also, we managed to jointly work on tickets, either in Forge or OTRS and were able to close a lot of tickets. Andri repaired the Spam learning mechanism in OTRS that has been implemented in our Sprint in May and reduced the amount of ticket Spam. Andri also built a ChefDk Docker Container which makes it easier to use Chef for all team members without a local installation of Chef. Andreas finished the LDAP update script and finally updated all typo3.org accounts.</p>
<h2><strong>A Report from the Documentation Team</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://typo3.org/article/recap-docs-team-joins-typo3org-sprint-wiesbaden/" target="_blank">last sprint where we met up with the t3o team</a> this year had already provided a number of possibilities for collaboration.</p>
<p>During this sprint, we looked for ways to improve the usability of the theme on <a href="https://docs.typo3.org/" target="_blank">docs.typo3.org</a> with members of the Design Team. The version selector is a topic that has come up several times this year, during camps or on Twitter.</p>
<p>Riona has created images to use for TYPO3 contribution tips on Twitter. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/T3docTeam" target="_blank">@T3DocTeam</a> to get the latest and greatest tips - now in improved design!</p>
<p>Additionally, we talked with Michael Stucki about working on the TYPO3 Wiki and improving the workflow for merging content into docs.typo3.org.</p>
<h2>Want to Join our Next Sprint?</h2>
<p>We posted about this sprint on the Events listing here on typo3.org and promoted it within Slack. Keep an eye out on the <a href="https://typo3.org/events" target="_blank">Events listing page</a> for news.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And join the <a href="https://my.typo3.org/about-mytypo3org/slack" target="_blank">TYPO3 Slack Team</a> and join the channels for various teams:</p>
<ul> 	<li> 	<p>#designteam</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>#typo3-server-team</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>#typo3-documentation</p> 	</li> </ul>

						<title>Better Multilingual Support with Crowdin</title>
						<link>https://typo3.org/article/better-multilingual-support-with-crowdin/</link>
						<description>The multilingual backend has always been a great benefit of TYPO3. Whether you’re French, German, or English-speaking, having the editing and administrative user interface in a language you understand means you can work faster and more confidently. After a long history with Pootle, TYPO3 is moving on to Crowdin, to take translation to the next level.</description>
						<enclosure url="https://typo3.org/fileadmin/t3o_common_storage/news/2019/09/IMG_8361.jpg" length="4230387" type="image/jpeg" />

<h2>Introducing Crowdin to TYPO3!</h2>
<p>Crowdin is a localization management platform and offers the core features essential for delivering great translation:</p>

						<description>The TYPO3 Conference 2019 gives you a chance to meet the people shaping this CMS for the future. New this year, the TYPO3 Conference is inviting attendees from business, government, NGOs, and higher education to join us for focused events that cater to their needs.</description>
						<enclosure url="https://typo3.org/fileadmin/t3o_common_storage/news/2019/09/csm_45545883_10156704978622398_4064700415495634944_o_43a767eb72.jpg" length="184361" type="image/jpeg" />

<h3>Three Summits Offering Three Views of TYPO3</h3>
<p>In addition to contributors and business leaders in the TYPO3 community, this event has also attracted people in IT leadership roles. Whether they are in business, government, or higher education, they want to learn more about the content management system that powers their websites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year we are offering three events catered to the needs of IT leadership and decision-makers. The three summits take place alongside the main event on Thursday, 17 October, day one of the TYPO3 Conference.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href="https://t3con19.typo3.com/summits/business-summit" target="_blank">The Business Summit</a></h3>
<p>Since TYPO3 CMS was launched 22 years ago, this content management system has been used to power tens of thousands of websites. Meanwhile, as businesses go completely digital, they increasingly see IT spend as a generator of customer value instead of a cost center.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://t3con19.typo3.com/summits/business-summit" target="_blank">Business Summit</a> includes five inspiring and practical sessions. Including a workshop on building a communication strategy. How to calculate the ROI and TCO of your web development project. Learn how the LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® method fosters innovation. And also <strong>How to make a digitalization roadmap</strong> that gives you a keen competitive edge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This culminates in a panel on The Business Value of Open Source to hear experienced leaders and experts discuss the business models available in the open-source world of co-creation, sharing, and flexibility.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href="https://t3con19.typo3.com/summits/government-ngo-summit" target="_blank">The Government/NGO Summit</a>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>For Government organizations and NGOs, TYPO3 provides a powerful multi-lingual platform to engage citizens and members. Digital services are improving access, but at the same time the challenge is even greater today. Sites for citizens and the public need to be fast on any device, secure, GDPR compliant, and accessible.</p>
<p>Accessibility is of primary importance for an association for the blind and visually impaired in Hesse. The TYPO3 website for <a href="https://typo3.com/case-studies/blinden-und-sehbehindertenbund-in-hessen-ev" target="_blank">Blinden- und Sehbehindertenbund in Hessen e. V</a> achieved a very high rating for their accessibility, scoring 98 out of 100 possible points on the comprehensive <a href="https://www.bitvtest.eu/" target="_blank">BIK BITV-Test</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://typo3.com/case-studies/federal-ministry-for-the-environment-nature-conservation-building-and-nuclear-safety" target="_blank">Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety</a>, is a cabinet-level ministry of the Federal Republic of Germany. Among their responsibilities of addressing new environmental challenges, they must also keep the public informed. The site has to be attractive, fast, and up-to-date.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://t3con19.typo3.com/summits/government-ngo-summit" target="_blank">Summit highlight: Political party CDA.nl and the National Cyber Security Centre</a></strong> have a great showcase of relevant external threats for your online platform and how to deal with them.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href="https://t3con19.typo3.com/summits/higher-education-universities-summit" target="_blank">The Higher Education Summit</a></h3>
<p>TYPO3 CMS provides higher education institutions with a platform to help them meet the communication demands. Universities need to provide an in-depth information portal for current students and to an attractive up-to-date presence for prospective students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re not talking about one or two websites either. The <a href="https://typo3.com/case-studies/universitaet-wien" target="_blank">University of Vienna</a> hosts almost 1,300 different domains to serve their community of students and staff. They do this all from one central installation of TYPO3. Learn more at the <a href="https://t3con19.typo3.com/summits/higher-education-universities-summit" target="_blank">Higher Education Summit</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://t3con19.typo3.com/summits/higher-education-universities-summit" target="_blank">Summit Highlight: From technical to cultural change.</a></strong> Michael Brinkwerth, Clausthal University of Technology / TU Clausthal. Also Eindhoven University of Technology is showing how to optimise a University website powered with TYPO3!</p>
<h2>Meet at the Summit!</h2>
<p>TYPO3 Conference affords participants a chance to learn more about the application they rely on. We spoke with Tracey Peers of Texere Publishing Ltd, about how TYPO3 CMS helped her online publishing business thrive and <a href="https://typo3.com/blog/typo3con-a-tech-conference-made-for-business-decision-makers" target="_blank">why tech leaders should attend events like T3CON</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p class="indent-1">“As a startup: every dollar, pound, euro counts… As a company, Texere can learn quite a lot from these conferences… Everybody is so helpful. You will definitely take good vibes away and you will absolutely learn something. So I would say <a href="https://t3con19.typo3.com/tickets" target="_blank">sign up and come along</a>.”&nbsp; - Tracey Peers, Co-Founder and COO, Texere Publishing</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the most important benefits is sharing knowledge with peers who are solving the same problems. Tracy Evans, who is leading the panel “The Business Value of Open Source” wrote&nbsp; “Engaging with the community around the OSS you are using, you’ll usually discover that others need similar functionality. They may have either already built it and ‘open-sourced’ it, making available for anyone to use,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/business-value-open-source-tracy-evans/" target="_blank">Business Value of Open Source</a>.</p>

<h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
<p>You may have noticed the design of our conference program and the one from <a href="https://t3dd19.typo3.com/program" target="_blank">TYPO3 Developer Days</a> looks the same. TYPO3 GmbH and the community event organizers have been working to create a robust TYPO3 distribution with capabilities to make it easier to manage event communications. This new system makes it easier to see which sessions are on when, so attendees can navigate a busy event. From an event management point of view, we’re delighted with how easy it is to display multi-track conference schedules, speaker profiles, session descriptions, and easy page layouts right out of the box.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Help us get the Word out—Tell us you’re Attending.</h2>
<p>This event helps the TYPO3 community connect to decision-makers who use TYPO3 every day. Here are some ways you can help get the word out about TYPO3 Conference 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tell folks you’re planning to attend #T3CON by RSVPing on your favorite social network.&nbsp;</p>
<ul> 	<li> 	<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1452777441531588/" target="_blank">RSVP on Facebook</a>, mark yourself as <a href="https://joind.in/event/14th-international-typo3-conference" target="_blank">“Attending” on Joind.in</a> or on our <a href="https://www.papercall.io/international-typo3-conference-2019" target="_blank">“Attending” on Papercall.io</a>.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>Share it on social media: Tweet that you’re attending, or share on LinkedIn.&nbsp;</p> 	</li> </ul>

						<title>Fluid 3.0: Workshop Summary &amp; Important Updates for Users</title>
						<link>https://typo3.org/article/fluid-30-workshop-summary-important-updates-for-users/</link>
						<description>The Fluid 3.0 workshop has ended and it’s time to summarise what we achieved during the workshop and what to expect from the up-coming 3.0 version of Fluid. </description>
						<enclosure url="https://typo3.org/fileadmin/t3o_common_storage/news/2019/08/IMG_1157__1_.jpg" length="2453452" type="image/jpeg" />
						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the new features are completed I will follow up with short, dedicated articles to give developers and users advance knowledge about what to expect when upgrading to Fluid 3.0, plus inspiration for new ways to structure your projects using Fluid.</p>
<p>We had two main topics for the workshop:</p>
<ol> 	<li> 	<p>Documentation</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>Development: specifically a reduction and unification of Fluid’s developer and user-facing APIs</p> 	</li> </ol>
<p>First I would like to thank Systime for their longstanding commitment to TYPO3 and for generously offering their space, time, food and all the effort that went into coordinating the workshop! An additional thank you to Unikka for sponsoring a round of pizzas, and to Felix Jacobi for sponsoring coffee for our participants. My company, NamelessCoder, sponsored a restaurant visit, but that’s me saying thank you to participants, not the other way around.</p>
<h2>Fluid 3.0 Workshop Recap and Results</h2>
<h3>Improvement to Fluid Documentation&nbsp;</h3>
<ul> 	<li> 	<p>We chose a strategy to use a landing page and separate Fluid’s documentation into two main parts: the quick “getting started” documentation to boot new users and get them familiar with syntax etc. and the more extensive API documentation for old and new developers who need to extend Fluid with things like custom ViewHelpers</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>We investigated how to improve the XSD files that Fluid generates with ViewHelper documentation to be much more informative and precise about argument types (adding things like PHP class names to the standard set of XSD properties like string, integer, etc.)</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>We also discussed the goal of rendering additional Fluid documentation to XSD files. For example, a manifest of template files and their required arguments</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>We briefly touched on a strategy to document the differences that will be introduced in Fluid 3.0 in a way that makes it easy to consume for anyone migrating. For example, by providing them with an “if you did this before, you need to do this now” type documentation to list the new practices that 1:1 replace old practices.</p> 	</li> </ul>
<h3>Improvements to Fluid Development&nbsp;</h3>
<ul> 	<li> 	<p>We prepared to introduce strict types in as many places as possible with the least amount of breaking changes to users. This work also revealed a number of smaller issues with tests in particular and allowed us to improve both code and tests</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>We also refined a solution to replace the use of regular expressions in Fluid. Historically, Fluid has been affected by a couple of issues related to regular expressions and recently a couple of serious problems were detected. The new solution will no longer use regular expressions to do template splitting, instead, a much more linear and platform-independent solution will be implemented. This new solution also facilitates a couple of new features which will be described in more detail later on</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>We discussed possibly viable alternatives to the fairly complex logic Fluid uses to compile&nbsp;templates to PHP classes, which in turn would allow us to simplify ViewHelpers to no longer distinguish between compiled/uncompiled states of execution and in turn reduce the complexity of ViewHelpers’ APIs</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>We then began work on unifying the internal API of Fluid. This work is the precursor to some essential features of Fluid 3.0, for example, parameterized templates and sections. We were not able to finish this part but are continuing with this topic following the workshop</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>We prepared to rename the Fluid composer package to <em>typo3/fluid-engine</em>. More information to follow about this change later on!</p> 	</li> </ul>
<p>After the workshop, I have continued to work on everything that was discussed and planned during the session. This work is now almost concluded and has ended up being a more or less complete rewrite of every part of Fluid from the ground up.</p>
<h2>Looking Forward: Fluid 3.0 Deprecations and Best Practices</h2>
<p>This means that version 3.0 brings a lot of deprecations, though of course all of the deprecated API now has new and better alternatives. The deprecations and future best practices are:</p>
<ul> 	<li> 	<p>A breaking change to solve parsing issues: This was the most critical, and a breaking change was necessary because the template parser has been completely rewritten. The breaking change affects cases where previously you had to intentionally break the parser’s detection. For example, when writing JS objects you may have needed to do something like &lt;f:format.raw&gt;{&lt;/f:format.raw&gt; to escape opening curly braces. <strong>Note this specific use now causes a parsing error!</strong> This only affects this use case and only when used on the opening curly brace. If you used it around a closing curly braces. there should be no problem at all. The reason is that Fluid’s parser is now sensitive to <em>sequence</em> alone and cannot be intentionally disrupted with enclosing tags. In the future, inline expressions which are not desired to be parsed as Fluid can be escaped by simply adding a backslash in front. For example, writing \{“foo”: “bar”} means the curlies’ content will be taken completely literally as a string</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>Fluid no longer uses caching. The Compiler scope is deleted and <strong>compile() methods will no longer be called</strong>. No PHP class versions of the template are created and there is only one representation of a template or component (ViewHelper or other) used within a template. This also means there is no cache warmup: new methods may be added to configure Fluid with complete class and file maps to make lookups static, but the impact would be minor.</p> 	</li> </ul>
<ul> 	<li> 	<p>The entire concept of <strong>partials, layouts and templates being different is deprecated</strong>. This three-way concept is reduced to a single concept: Atoms. The new concept serves the same purpose as partials and layouts.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>The entire <strong>View scope—interfaces, abstract classes, and the TemplatePaths class—have all been deprecated</strong>. Fluid 3.0 will no longer impose any decisions whatsoever on how a template is rendered. This entire scope is replaced with a <em>FluidRenderer</em>&nbsp;class that takes a filename as the entry point. Just the file and context, no MVC orientation or anything else. This combined with the Atoms concept completely replaces Fluid’s old template resolving and layout/partial usages.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>There are <strong>no more template pre-processors</strong> and the feature itself is removed.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong>ViewHelpers are completely reworked</strong> and offer a lot of new abilities. The most important change is the removal of deprecated properties “templateVariableContainer” and “viewHelperVariableContainer” which must now be accessed via the RenderingContext.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong>ViewHelpers’ render() and renderStatic() methods are now considered deprecated.</strong> Instead, ViewHelpers may implement the evaluate() method which takes RenderingContext argument. This will be the future best-practice implementation</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>As of 3.0 usage of <strong>render() or renderStatic() merely results in execution overhead</strong> in terms of both CPU cycles and memory.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong>The base class for ViewHelpers still exists but is now completely optional.</strong> It now only provides utility methods and support for old ViewHelper practices like using render(). A ViewHelper can from now on extend AbstractComponent or no base class at all, and then completely change every method of the API</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong>InterceptorInterface has been removed.</strong> Interception is no longer possible to affect without, for example, implementing it as a ViewHelper. Escaping is now a built-in and default-enabled feature which has to be explicitly disabled through configuration</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong>Expressions are no longer separate from ViewHelpers.</strong> A ViewHelper can implement a new interface to signal it also works as expression (e.g. math {foo + 1} expressions) and when Fluid parses an expression it simply creates the corresponding ViewHelper instance. This means that the ViewHelper works both as expression and as ViewHelper. Math for example works as {foo + 1} but also as {f:expression.math(a: foo, b: 1, operator: ‘+’)} for more complex use cases</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>Although not exactly a removal or deprecation: <strong>escaping quotes in nested inline syntax is no longer necessary</strong> at all. Fluid 3.0 ignores such escaping and is therefore compatible, but new templates can be written without regard to quote escaping. The sequence alone matters, i.e. your quote pairs must still match but you can use the same type of quote in all nesting levels</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>There are other deprecations not mentioned here but they all affect API that has never been considered truly public</p> 	</li> </ul>
<h3>Substituted Feature Use</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, the deprecations and removals have been quite severe on everything except for the most important context: the template file itself. As far as possible the template writing practices have not been changed, but there are some rather important impacts in the form of substituted features which have to be used differently. These are:</p>
<ul> 	<li> 	<p><strong>Atoms is a new concept to replace partials and layouts.</strong> An Atom can work both as layout and as partial depending on what it contains and where it is used. Atoms are registered much like ViewHelpers to belong to a namespace, and each namespace then has multiple file system paths where lookups will be done. When an Atom is used within a template that contains nothing but sections, it works like a layout does today. When used somewhere inside a template it works like a partial. A major difference is that an Atom can be created to contain only sections, and when used, this causes the sections to be imported to the current template (and be possible to overwrite by defining new sections with the same name). Practical examples of this new concept will be provided before release. <strong>The main point is that f:layout and f:render’s <em>partial</em>&nbsp;argument are both deprecated, as are <em>partialRootPaths</em></strong>&nbsp;and all other template path collections</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>An Atom might, for example, exist in res/atoms/myAtom.html. Registering an Atom namespace “foo” with the path res/atoms/ then means that &lt;foo:myAtom&gt; in Fluid renders or imports the template and sections within, or causes it to work the same way a layout works today. These paths arrays support multiple paths and can be extended the same way “partialRootPaths” and others are extended today</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong>Some rarely used toggles like {escaping off} now have to be written as {@escaping off}</strong> or they will be ignored. The risk of these actually being used in real-life projects is very low, and you will know immediately if this affects you. The only exception is {namespace xyz=Foo\Bar} which has special handling (deprecated, removed in 4.0). In the future though these must be written as {@namespace xyz=Foo\Bar}</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong>Namespace extraction from (X)HTML nodes now only works for &lt;html&gt; tags</strong> but other than this, it works precisely as before. If you used a &lt;div xmlns:f=“…”&gt; you will need to change this to &lt;html&gt; instead</p> 	</li> </ul>
<p>The good news is that there is an incredible amount of new syntax features that have been enabled, are fully compatible with old syntax, but provide lots and lots of new ways to declare arrays, get simpler inline syntax, handle vanilla (X)HTML tags with ViewHelper classes and much more.</p>
<p>A demonstration repository will be created well before the 3.0 release which can be cloned and edited to study all of Fluid’s new features.</p>
<p><strong>Release of Fluid 3.0 is currently not scheduled. It is not expected to be used in v10 LTS and will most likely not become a dependency of TYPO3 until v11 development, which follows almost immediately after v10 LTS is released.</strong></p>
<p>I hope you are now well informed and updated of all the positive developments for Fluid 3.0. Watch this space for more articles for Fluid 3.0 users.</p>

						<title>The TYPO3 Extbase Book—Interview with the Author</title>
						<link>https://typo3.org/article/the-typo3-extbase-book-interview-with-the-author/</link>
						<description>Michael Schams has been an active member of the TYPO3 Community for more than a decade now. In May 2019 he published the third edition of the TYPO3 Extbase book. Michael worked with Patrick Lobacher on previous editions of the book, but since Patrick moved on to new challenges, Michael took over full responsibility in 2018 and published a fully revised and updated edition this year. Luisa Faßbender held an interview with Michael to find out more about the book and how it was created.</description>
						<enclosure url="https://typo3.org/fileadmin/t3o_common_storage/news/2019/08/typo3extbase-3rd-edition-banner02b.png" length="764181" type="image/png" />
						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>(Luisa) Hi Michael! It’s so nice to meet you! How are you today?</strong></p>
<p>(Michael) Hi Luisa. Thanks, I am very well—you know, it’s Friday afternoon and I look forward to enjoying a relaxed weekend.</p>
<p><strong>(Luisa) Before getting into the topic of today's interview: We all know you've been really active in the TYPO3 Community for quite a while. But for those who don't know you: Would you mind telling us a little bit about yourself and how you got into TYPO3?</strong></p>
<p>(Michael) I studied in Germany and I hold a master's degree in Computer Sciences. In 2008 I moved to Australia and have been living in Melbourne since then. The first TYPO3 version I worked with was version 3.x, more than 15 years ago. However, I did not start working with TYPO3 “professionally” until 2008-ish when I joined the company I am still working for today. I am an advocate for open-source technologies and besides my day-to-day job I write articles for technical journals, for example the “web &amp; mobile developer”.</p>
<p><strong>(Luisa) You published several other books like the <a href="https://leanpub.com/typo3certifiedintegrator-en" target="_blank">TYPO3 CMS Certified Integrator Study Guide</a>. What drives you to put so much time and energy into TYPO3 and the Community?</strong></p>
<p>(Michael) TYPO3 is a great system and extremely powerful and flexible. However, you need the knowledge and experience to manage an application of this complexity. The TYPO3 Documentation Team does a fantastic job, but many people ask for resources and learning material beyond the official manuals. The TCCI book (TYPO3 CMS Certified Integrator), and in particular the TYPO3 Extbase book aim to fill this gap.</p>
<p><strong>(Luisa) The third edition of the TYPO3 Extbase book is the first version you published without Patrick. How did that change things for you?</strong></p>
<p>(Michael) I really enjoyed working with Patrick. His experience in more than 150&nbsp; seminars, where he trained developers in Extbase and Fluid was very valuable. The structure of the Extbase book is based on his experience and this has proven very successful for many years. Therefore, I did not change this aspect. However, the previous edition of the book is based on TYPO3 v7 and had to be revised and updated. This workload, as well as the research, tests, etc. was now my responsibility alone — and I can tell you, that’s massive work (but also interesting).</p>
<p><strong>(Luisa) Why do we even need Extbase? What would you say are the main advantages compared to Pi-Base i.e.?</strong></p>
<p>(Michael) Extbase is a so-called object-oriented framework written in PHP. Frameworks let you streamline the development process by providing a basic structure, which reduces the amount of repetitive code. As a result, extensions can be built quickly and they are more stable and more secure compared to traditional software development methods. On top of that, Extbase follows the paradigm “convention over configuration”. Once a developer knows the conventions, he/she automatically knows class and method names, properties, where to find files and directories, etc. Following the convention makes an extension logical and easy to understand for other developers.</p>
<p><strong>(Luisa) So... are you gonna be the next Extbase Evangelist? ;-)</strong></p>
<p>(Michael) (Laughing!) No, not really, Luisa! Firstly, there are experts in the TYPO3 Community who know the Extbase internals much better than I do and who have much more experience with it. Secondly, while developing extensions with Extbase is pretty cool and straightforward, some functions can be implemented in a better way.</p>
<p><strong>(Luisa) Can you elaborate on this a little more?</strong></p>
<p>(Michael) Due to the domain-driven design concept (DDD) and the model-view-controller architecture (MVC), Extbase and Fluid are great solutions for frontend plugins and backend modules. However, for some simple or low-level tasks such as AJAX responses, the Extbase overhead can be overkill. The PSR-15 middleware provided by the TYPO3 core are good examples.</p>
<p><strong>(Luisa) You mentioned research and testing before. How long does it take to come up with all the new content, proofread, publish etc.?</strong></p>
<p>(Michael) Planning the “project” begun in mid 2018. When TYPO3 v9 LTS came out in October 2018, I started to research and test the new methods. It took several months before I handed over the manuscript to my proof-reader. Inge Bateman did a fantastic job: she has not only improved the quality of the content significantly, but she did the review in an incredible short amount of time.</p>
<p>Actually, everyone I approached in the last few months provided valuable feedback: core developers, experienced Extbase developers as well as Fluid experts.</p>
<p><strong>(Luisa) What changes can readers expect? Which new aspects and new topics did you implement primarily?</strong></p>
<p>(Michael) The previous edition of the TYPO3 Extbase book was based on TYPO3 v7. Many things have changed in TYPO3 v8 and v9 and the most important aspect for the new edition of the book was to make sure that all new techniques, methods, APIs are taken into account and the book follows best practises for TYPO3 v9 LTS. This includes clean code with PHP version 7.2, as well as a setup with PHP Composer for example. The third edition of the TYPO3 Extbase book also uses the TYPO3 Query Builder (Doctrine DBAL) and new annotations used in v9.</p>
<p>In addition, the reader learns how to develop a backend module that uses AJAX and RequireJS. This is a completely new chapter, as well as the chapter about security basics in TYPO3 extensions.</p>
<p><strong>(Luisa) Your book covers the basics of Extbase and Fluid based extension development as well as more advanced topics: Who would you say is the book’s main target group?</strong></p>
<p>(Michael) The first chapters of the book cover fundamentals. For example the basics of object-oriented programming in PHP and what DDD means. This is followed by practical explanations on how to set up a TYPO3 instance as a development environment using Composer. While these topics provide all the details required for beginners to get started, more advanced developers are likely more interested in the subsequent chapters.</p>
<p><strong>(Luisa) So, the more you progress, the deeper you dive into the subject?</strong></p>
<p>(Michael) That’s right. Each chapter builds on the previous chapter. The book demonstrates all steps that are required to develop a modern TYPO3 extension.&nbsp; By following the tutorials in the book, learners complete a fully functional Extbase/Fluid extension. They can use what they learn to develop their own extensions.</p>
<p><strong>(Luisa) The book features 19 comprehensive chapters. Did you ever consider splitting the content into two books?</strong></p>
<p>(Michael) Oh, yes! I had to pull myself back a few times. There are so many interesting aspects which would be worth mentioning. I had to remind myself to not lose the focus and to concentrate on TYPO3 Extbase.</p>
<p>I also considered moving some content to a new book which would then allow me to go into even more detail, but then I would have never finished this book.</p>
<p><strong>(Luisa) What are these other aspects and is this something you consider writing about in the future?</strong></p>
<p>(Michael) The TYPO3 core offers many great APIs: the Mailer API, the Context API, user authentication, SEO and so on. The majority is well explained in the official documentation by the TYPO3 Documentation Team and the Core Team, but a practical learning book usually goes beyond a collection of references and “how-tos”.</p>
<p><strong>(Luisa) Does the TYPO3 Extbase book compete against the official TYPO3 documentation?</strong></p>
<p>(Michael) Definitely not. However, the existing resources about Extbase are not ideal to say at least. The book guides the reader through a process, step-by-step, chapter-by-chapter. A manual cannot and should not be so comprehensive and detailed.</p>
<p><strong>(Luisa) What’s your personal favourite chapter in the book and why is that?</strong></p>
<p>(Michael) All chapters are pretty awesome! (laughing). Seriously: I like to get new insights in a very practical way. Personally, I want to actually <em>do</em> something better sooner than later, instead of working through hundreds of pages of theoretical basics. As pointed out before, the first few chapters of the book focus on fundamentals. The more you progress through the book, the more practical it becomes. This means, you should follow every step by developing the extension as described in the book. I like when I can actually see that something evolves, when the first functions work and I understand how and why. This is what I tried to reflect in the book.</p>
<p>My personal favorite topic is the chapter about security basics in TYPO3 extensions though.</p>
<p><strong>(Luisa) Security is obviously really important. Can you tell us why you added this chapter and what it covers?</strong></p>
<p>(Michael) Security has always been a hot topic. Hacked websites, stolen sensitive data, and leaked confidential information have a huge impact and can result in significant financial and reputation loss. Looking at the security advisories published by the TYPO3 Security Team in the last few years, most of the vulnerabilities did not occur in the TYPO3 core but in a variety of TYPO3 extensions. The dedicated chapter &quot;Security Basics&quot; explains, how security processes work in the TYPO3 universe and what&nbsp; typical SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities look like in an extension. If extension developers understand the background, they know how to avoid these vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><strong>(Luisa) Can we expect a fourth edition of the book in the future?</strong></p>
<p>(Michael) This is a good question, but too early to think about it, to be honest. TYPO3 v9 LTS will be supported until October 2021, so the content of the Extbase book as it stands now remains valid for another two years at least. TYPO3 v10 LTS is scheduled in April 2020 with the first sprint release (version 10.0) published just a few weeks ago. There are already some exciting new features and API changes in this sprint release, which could go into the Extbase book at one point.</p>
<p>Let's see what happens in the next 6 to 8 months, before I make any promises.</p>
<p><strong>(Luisa) The last two questions: where can someone buy the TYPO3 Extbase book and in which languages is the book available?</strong></p>
<p>(Michael) The TYPO3 Extbase book is available as an <a href="https://leanpub.com/typo3extbase-3rd-edition-en" target="_blank">eBook at Leanpub </a>(PDF, ePub, MOBI) and as a printed copy at Amazon. At the moment, the book is only available in English, but a German translation is currently in progress. However, no publishing date has been scheduled for the German version yet.</p>
<p><strong>(Luisa) Thank you so much Michael. Not only for taking the time for this interview, but also for the insights of how the book was created and what it covers. I’m sure it will help many people to get started on extension development and to improve their programming skills. I wish you every success with the book.</strong></p>
<p>(Michael) It was a pleasure to talk with you, Luisa. Thanks for the opportunity to present the book.</p>]]></content:encoded>

						<title>Documentation Recap from the TYPO3 Fluid 3.0 Workshop</title>
						<link>https://typo3.org/article/documentation-recap-from-the-typo3-fluid-30-workshop/</link>
						<description>The TYPO3 Documentation Team accepted Claus Due’s invitation to his TYPO3 Fluid 3.0 Workshop in Aarhus, Denmark.</description>
						<enclosure url="https://typo3.org/fileadmin/t3o_common_storage/news/2019/08/image1.png" length="5280184" type="image/png" />
						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This article covers the Fluid 3.0 Workshop. Also, upcoming plans for Fluid are detailed.</p>
<h2>History and Current State</h2>
<p><a href="/fluid/">Fluid</a> is a standalone Template Engine for the web language PHP. It was initially developed within the TYPO3 Flow web framework, and now everyone can use Fluid. It is used by TYPO3 CMS, Flow, and Neos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Claus Due is the current <a href="/community/teams/typo3-development/">Component Merger</a> for Fluid and responsible for the integration with TYPO3 CMS. As such, he is responsible for Fluid’s code, functionality, backward-compatibility, architecture, and future development.</p>
<p>Up until now, there has been little documentation, only available within the <a href="https://github.com/TYPO3/Fluid" target="_blank">Fluid repository on GitHub</a>, without details on using Fluid with TYPO3. So that is what we focused on in the workshop.</p>
<h2>Workshop 3.0</h2>
<p>Claus Due <a href="/article/join-us-at-the-fluid-30-workshop-in-denmark/">invited</a> everyone to participate in Fluid 3.0. The upcoming release will include breaking changes and introduces entirely new concepts. These concepts make Fluid even more flexible. One could, for example, adopt Fluid for design approaches like <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/" target="_blank">Atomic Design</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the workshop four volunteers from the <a href="/community/teams/documentation/">Documentation Team</a> focused on these improvements in Fluid’s documentation.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How to Document</h3>
<p>To get started with documentation, you need to agree on how you’re going to write documentation and make sure all the tools and processes are in place for collaboration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We discussed Markdown because it’s a popular method for formatting text. However, the official TYPO3 documentation uses reStructuredText (reST). Markdown is similar to reST, but it has less features, and some inconsistent quirks when it’s rendered in various formats. You can read more about the decision not to use Markdown here:<a href="https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/docs-how-to-document/master/en-us/GeneralConventions/Format.html" target="_blank"> Writing Documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By sticking with reStructuredText, Fluid’s documentation will follow all the conventions we’re using in TYPO3 documentation, and later, we can integrate the documentation into existing workflows and infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Improve XSD</h3>
<p>XSD (XML Schema Definition), is an XML technology used under the hood. XSD powers auto-completion within IDEs and powers the auto-generated <a href="https://docs.typo3.org/other/typo3/view-helper-reference/9.5/en-us/" target="_blank">ViewHelper Reference</a>, which is already generated for TYPO3 CMS 9.5 and Fluid 2.x. There were some limitations in the current implementation. During the Workshop, we managed to get around these and started to work on implementation.</p>
<p>This especially showed how awesome Workshops and Sprints can be for all participants. We started to work with pair programming and test-driven development. As we already knew the goal, the new XSD format, we were able to start by writing tests beforehand and to adjust code afterward.</p>
<p>Once finished, the XSD will transport even more information, e.g. allowing PHP Types as Arguments for ViewHelper. It will also be possible to provide multiple possible Types per Argument. This will then be reflected in the auto-generated Reference.</p>
<h3>Writing Documentation</h3>
<p>Without proper documentation, it’s much harder to get started with Fluid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Projects might not even consider Fluid as a possible template engine alternative because of the lack of documentation. Therefore we started building the documentation from existing sources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We started with a table of contents, adding in existing documentation from GitHub. We also had the information at fluidtypo3.org in mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also added a list of sections referencing Fluid to docs.typo3.org. As part of the “Plans for future” (see below) the TYPO3 community will manage this documentation on docs.typo3.org</p>
<p>We highly appreciate the work of Usman Ahmad and Itishree Ghunghru on that topic. They kickstarted the first version of the documentation, based upon the existing sources.</p>
<p>We also highly appreciate the work of Tom Warwick. He collected sources mentioning the Fluid template engine in various places. Also thanks for providing native speaker insights.</p>
<h2>Plans for the Future</h2>
<h3>Finish XSD</h3>
<p>The implementation of new features needs to be finished. Some more tests and code has to be written. Also, tools working with the XSD, like the <a href="https://github.com/maddy2101/fluid-documentation-generator" target="_blank">fluid-documentation-generator</a>, need adjustments in the end in order to make use of the new information. <a href="https://github.com/TYPO3/Fluid.SchemaGenerator/" target="_blank">The tool to generate XSD can be found on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h3>Finish First Version of Documentation</h3>
<p>There is still a lot of work. All sources have to be merged into the documentation system. This has to contain all information to start with Fluid as a standalone template engine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides that, all existing sources need adjustments. They should reference the official Fluid documentation and only provide more specific information on top. Current plans are to deprecate fluidtypo3.org in favour of new official documentation on docs.typo3.org.</p>
<h2>Say Thanks</h2>
<p>Thanks to all the participants. We know some of you had really long journeys. Also big thanks to the host <a href="https://systime.dk/" target="_blank">Systime</a>, for the venue. Their breakfast, lunch, drinks, and atmosphere were really great. And of course thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/NamelessCoder" target="_blank">Claus Due</a> for inviting, providing self-brewed beer, self-made coffee, and taking documentation seriously.</p>

						<title>A Structured Content Initiative</title>
						<link>https://typo3.org/article/a-structured-content-initiative/</link>
						<description>Without extensions like Gridelements and Flux, creating and editing semantically and hierarchically structured content can be difficult in TYPO3. </description>
						<enclosure url="https://typo3.org/fileadmin/t3o_common_storage/news/2019/06/danae-paparis-cj6Am4O7YJs-unsplash.jpg" length="1037829" type="image/jpeg" />
						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some use cases developers and integrators can struggle with are flexible accordions, content containers as content elements, content element placement restrictions, and drag and drop. Unfortunately, this has often led to difficulties with upgrades or migrations.</p>
<p>At the <a href="https://www.typo3camp-mitteldeutschland.de/" target="_blank">2018 TYPO3 Camp Mitteldeutschland</a> in Dresden, Germany, this topic once again gained popularity and an interest group started discussions in the TYPO3 Slack channel <a href="https://typo3.slack.com/messages/C8Z2UM50Q" target="_blank">#cig-structuredcontent</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Now, things have become serious through the creation of the <a href="/community/teams/typo3-development/initiatives/structured-content/">Structured Content Initiative</a>.</strong></p>
<h2>Better Support for Custom Content Elements</h2>
<p>The main goal of this initiative is to build better, native support for custom, semantically structured content element types in TYPO3. We would like to:</p>
<ul> 	<li> 	<p>Create a <strong>better experience for editors</strong> to work with content types in a more intuitive way</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>Enable integrators to <strong>easily create flexible and reusable content types</strong>. These content types will not be bound to layouts, templates, or technologies like FlexForms</p> 	</li> </ul>
<p>Our agreed focus will be to not look at the current implementations and limitations first, but to rather find the best user experience, then look at the technology!</p>
<h2>A Huge Task—Three Working Groups</h2>
<p>Our analysis of what we understand as structured content, our expectations of the initiative, and a look at other CMS providers, showed that this is a very complex topic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To achieve results quickly, we identified three main parts that should be covered by separate working groups:</p>
<h3>1. Editing Interface User Experience Group</h3>
<p>This working group will develop a concept for UX, creating wireframes, mockups and layouts, in order to make content management for the editor as intuitive as possible.</p>
<h3>2. Content Element Creation Group</h3>
<p>The focus of this working group will be to simplify the creation process for content elements and their hierarchical relationships by taking registration and maintenance into consideration. This group will create a technical concept as well as evaluate the processes for storing and connecting content element data.</p>
<h3>3. Rendering Group</h3>
<p>Containers, wrappers etc. will be this working group’s focus. Their first goal will be to develop a concept for semantic content interpretation in the frontend (e.g. by using modern markup to better identify coherent structures).</p>
<p>These working groups will operate in parallel and continuously share their work in progress and ideas to support their common goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently we have one slack call a month, but there is no fixed schedule yet. The working groups will create their own schedules, and we will keep up the monthly calls to exchange information between the groups (note participation is not mandatory for all group members!).</p>
<h2>Get Involved and Join Forces!</h2>
<p>It doesn‘t matter if you know the core or not. Our first steps will be to create concepts. We would like to define how things should behave to make both editing and development easier. Of course, we are also looking for technical people too, especially for the later steps.</p>
<p>We are also interested in joining forces with other initiatives that intersect with our working areas. If you have thoughts or ideas on this topic, please feel free to share them with us and enhance our concepts.</p>

<h2>Documentation Team</h2>
<p>Good documentation is key to successful product adoption and use. The TYPO3 company supported the Documentation Team by <a href="/article/docstypo3org-gets-new-infrastructure/">providing a modern infrastructure for core and extension documentation</a>.</p>
<h2>CMS Africa Summit 2019</h2>
<p>Mathias Schreiber was part of the delegation <a href="/article/making-typo3-global-cms-africa-summit-2019/">representing the TYPO3 project at the CMS Africa Summit</a>.</p>
<h2>Internal Processes</h2>
<p>We are looking for new office space. This is needed to support company growth and to better serve our community. For example, our new office will have the space to host code sprints and certifications.</p>
<h2>Products</h2>
<p>Our next product will be the official <a href="https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/google_ads/" target="_blank">Google Ads Extension</a>. This product has high future potential. Not only for the financial benefit of TYPO3 GmbH, but also for our agency members, who will have a new USP to offer their customers.</p>
<p>In our meeting we discussed more ideas for additional services that the company could offer.</p>
<h2>Development</h2>
<p>TYPO3 LTS 9 and security releases have been the main subject for core development. Benny Mack and TYPO3 GmbH have worked together to reorganize the Core Team. The next focus will be the development of TYPO3 v10.</p>
<h2>Financial Situation</h2>
<p>The income was better than planned, and the <a href="https://typo3.com/products/extended-support" target="_blank">ELTS program</a>&nbsp;has been a success. But as upgrades are getting less complex for the TYPO3 core, we anticipate that income may shrink over the next few years.</p>
<p>Thanks to the current positive financial situation, we could reduce the credit line granted by the TYPO3 Association.</p>
<h2>Introducing a Structured Controlling Process</h2>
<p>Now that the “start up” is established, we are aiming for a more structured way of controlling and monitoring success. During our meeting we developed several KPIs that we will review on a monthly basis.</p>
<h2>Outlook</h2>
<p>In the coming months TYPO3 GmbH will focus on organizing some official events, including <a href="https://t3dd19.typo3.com" target="_blank">TYPO3 Developer Days 2019</a>, <a href="http://t3con19.typo3.com" target="_blank">T3CON19</a>&nbsp;and the TYPO3 Award 2019. While also working on getting the new <a href="https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/google_ads/" target="_blank">Google Ads extension</a> released! Watch this space.</p>

						<title>docs.typo3.org Gets New Infrastructure</title>
						<link>https://typo3.org/article/docstypo3org-gets-new-infrastructure/</link>
						<description>docs.typo3.org is now hosted by TYPO3 Inc. and gets a modern setup using Bamboo as
CI (Continuous Integration) solution for rendering.</description>
						<enclosure url="https://typo3.org/fileadmin/t3o_common_storage/news/2019/05/typo3-docs-new-infrastructure.jpg" length="152313" type="image/jpeg" />
						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are some insights in the process, the reasons why the infrastructure was changed, and the benefits summary for TYPO3.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before the change, docs.typo3.org was actually a development system for the Documentation Team. It was never meant to be a production environment. The system was cluttered with many different scripts and solutions by different team members, amassed over the years.</p>
<p>Some may recognize this situation and think about the technical complexities. The existing infrastructure made it hard for us to change certain parts of docs.typo3.org. E.g., many 404 Not Found requests were generated once manuals and sections were moved around. Users of the ViewHelper Reference have seen that, especially in December 2018 and January 2019. Those problems were nearly impossible to solve for us as a team, due to the legacy system.</p>
<p>The system also prevented us from using Docker. Right now we provide a Docker Container for rendering. This Container could not be used on production, due to the old system.</p>
<p>There was a need for change.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>The Documentation Team (Martin Bless and Daniel Siepmann) headed to the headquarters of TYPO3 Inc. and met with Mathias Schreiber and Christian Kuhn. We sat together for a day and discussed the future of docs.typo3.org. During this meeting the requirements were defined, and some ideas noted on how to meet these requirements. The requirements were:</p>
<h3>Support Composer</h3>
<p>TYPO3 as a project wants to improve the support of <a href="https://getcomposer.org/" target="_blank">Composer</a>&nbsp;in third party extensions.<br /> This is solved by requiring every project (manuals and extensions) to immediately provide a valid composer.json in order to be rendered.</p>
<h3>Scalability</h3>
<p>docs.typo3.org needs to scale. This point consists of multiple self enclosed &nbsp;&nbsp;requirements. The <a href="/community/teams/documentation/">Documentation Team</a>&nbsp;consists of three people, who already have a &nbsp;lot of work to do. In order to scale, some recurring procedures need to be automatic or easy to solve:</p>
<ol> 	<li> 	<p><strong>Make it easy to auto render documentation.</strong><br /> 	<br /> 	Now everyone can include a hook in his GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket repository. Also &quot;custom&quot; hosters are supported. Each push can trigger the rendering via a <a href="https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/docs-how-to-document/master/en-us/WritingDocForExtension/Webhook.html" target="_blank">web hook</a>. If you encounter any issue, inform the Documentation Team.<br /> 	&nbsp;</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong>Allow easy previewing of rendered documentation before release.</strong><br /> 	<br /> 	Some extension authors already know this pain. A new release is done, and there is an issue inside of the Documentation. The authors can now render the documentation locally upfront using the provided <a href="https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/docs-how-to-document/master/en-us/RenderingDocs/Quickstart.html" target="_blank">Docker Container</a>.<br /> 	<br /> 	Now they can also push changes to a branch documentation-draft to generate a non indexed preview of the documentation.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong>Allow managing of redirects.</strong> Now it's possible to add redirects for whole manuals and single URLs through a web UI.<br /> 	<br /> 	Also larger rewrites can be provided by configuring the nginx web server.<br /> 	<br /> 	Why do we need to worry about scale? TYPO3 plans to expand in further countries where more people would read and contribute to docs.typo3.org. Also more extensions might be developed, requiring additional support for their documentation..</p> 	</li> </ol>
<h3>A Self Documented Environment</h3>
<p>We now have a self-documented environment. This is done by using <a href="https://bamboo.typo3.com/" target="_blank">Bamboo</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://intercept.typo3.com/" target="_blank">Intercept</a>. Bamboo contains the CI and defines how documentation gets rendered. People can have a look into the bash script and know exactly what's going on.<br /> <br /> Intercept, the middleware developed by TYPO3 Inc., is also providing the connection &nbsp;between all systems. The whole source code is open source. Everyone can<a href="https://bitbucket.typo3.com/projects/INT/repos/intercept/" target="_blank"> have a look</a>&nbsp;and provide pull requests.<br /> <br /> There is no more hidden source code, or odd cron jobs within a server, hiding knowledge from the community.</p>
<h3>Multi-language Support</h3>
<p>Translation of manuals already was supported, but rarely worked. This is now solved with a clean new URL structure. Authors are able to provide specific language by locales, e.g., en-US or de-AT, in their documentation.</p>
<h3>Make Contributions Easier</h3>
<p>Some might want to contribute to Documentation through the rendering chain, deployment, or further logic. This is now possible, as all parts are publicly available and self documented. More contributors can assist with their particular expertise.</p>
<h3>Knowing the Contents of docs.typo3.org</h3>
<p>This is done by Intercept. Being the single point of truth, Intercept knows about every single request for rendering documentation. Also all results from Bamboo are reported back to Intercept. Thus Intercept is able to know the content of docs.typo3.org. The Documentation Team can delete and re-render any available documentation through a simple web ui.<br /> <br /> This web UI is <a href="https://intercept.typo3.com/admin/docs/deployments" target="_blank">publicly available</a>. Anonymous users won't have the opportunity to trigger some actions, but still can search through all available manuals.</p>
<h3>Support Surf and Fluid Documentation</h3>
<p>TYPO3 provides not only the CMS and third party extensions, but also Surf as a deployment solution and Fluid as a template engine. Both products need a place to provide their own documentation.<br /> <br /> This is now done through the exact same workflows, except they have a custom build plan <a href="https://bamboo.typo3.com/browse/CORE" target="_blank">within Bamboo</a>. Using this system Surf and Fluid ViewHelper References are already rendered.<br /> <br /> Later this year, official documentation for Fluid <a href="https://typo3.org/article/join-us-at-the-fluid-30-workshop-in-denmark/" target="_blank">may follow</a>.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>It turns out that we had a lot of requirements that were time consuming to solve. Luckily, TYPO3 Inc. could jump in and invested the necessary effort. They blended the existing knowledge of Documentation Team into TYPO3’s current systems. TYPO3 Inc. has handed the system over to the Documentation Team, and it is in full control.</p>
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>We now have a state of the art infrastructure. Every author can add a Webhook to their repository to trigger the rendering of his documentation. Only version tags in the form of Major.Minor.Patch are rendered, together with master Branch and documentation-draft Branch.</p>
<p>The Documentation Team now has a modern web UI to solve typical use cases like adding redirects or investing rendering issues. All requests through webhooks and all responses from Bamboo are logged and are accessible through the web UI.</p>
<p>The new docs.typo3.org also provides a new canonical routing in the form of /type/vendor/name/version/locale, e.g., /p/typo3/form/9.5/en-US.</p>
<p>NOTE: There are no patch level versions available anymore.</p>
<h2>Call to Action</h2>
<p>In order to allow the rendering for your extension, <strong>add a valid composer.json to your project</strong>. This has to provide a dependency on typo3/cms-core with supported versions. <a href="https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/docs-how-to-document/master/en-us/WritingDocForExtension/Webhook.html" target="_blank">Add the new webhook to your repository</a>&nbsp;(remove the old one if it exists).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Documentation Team also welcomes contributions from the entire TYPO3 community. <strong>You can help improve our documentation</strong> by editing and proofreading existing docs. Check out the previous <a href="https://typo3.com/blog/start-improving-docs-now-to-grow-typo3" target="_blank">blog post regarding contributions</a>.</p>

						<title>Making TYPO3 Global—CMS Africa Summit 2019 </title>
						<link>https://typo3.org/article/making-typo3-global-cms-africa-summit-2019/</link>
						<description>The TYPO3 Association was among the sponsors of the CMS Africa Summit 2019. We came away inspired with new ideas and direct connections to one of the fastest-growing tech communities in the world.</description>
						<enclosure url="https://typo3.org/fileadmin/t3o_common_storage/news/2019/05/IMG_20190315_105128.jpg" length="3628238" type="image/jpeg" />
						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Creating Opportunities by Increasing Access to Open Source</h3>
<p>CMS Africa Summit 2019 founder and journalist Oduor Jagero said this annual event was “first of all, about bringing people together.” Oduor been spearheading this annual event since 2014, bringing it to a new country in Africa each year.</p>
<p>“For every edition, our core team relocates to a new country for several months to help prepare the Summit. Half the year we work on our jobs, then the other half of the year we prepare for the event. I am not doing it for the money. I am doing it because the Summit helps people.”</p>
<p>“Attendees come together from all over Africa to get to know each other, to learn together, and connect. Connections are the most important goal and we are open to everyone.”</p>
<p>Bringing the event to different places throughout Africa is one way to make the event accessible and increase the reach of open source. The organizers aim to make the event as affordable as possible through the help of sponsors. “If someone wants to come but cannot afford it, we try to help. Students, for example, might be interested but not have the means. So it happens that we give most of the tickets for free. But that’s all right. We help as we can. We are a family.”</p>
<p>Over a continent of 54 countries and 5,000 plus ethnicities, Oduor, David, Fred and the rest of the team behind CMS Africa Summit bring people together. They use their combined passion for programming to work towards a better future. By involving young people, they increase their chances of improved job opportunities available in the open source CMS world.</p>
<h3>The CMS Africa Summit Showcases Opportunity</h3>
<p>Looking back at the African history of social struggle, upheavals and segregation, it’s inspiring to see this pan-African conference gaining traction year after year. As it grows, it gathers attendees from many countries, not only Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, South Africa, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, but also from Europe. This event is a great opportunity to support the African tech community. It showcases the talent, skills, motivation, enthusiasm of the attendees and speakers: all united by a drive to learn more about the latest CMS technology.</p>
<p>The CMS Africa Summit also provides opportunities for European digital agencies to seek out partnerships and to build bridges with African digital agencies. The growth of African economies has been outpacing European economies for some time. A net GDP growth of over 5% per year is not a rarity, with champions like Ethiopia at 7.5% or Rwanda at 7.2%. To put this into perspective, the net growth of Germany is 1.9%.</p>
<p>In the last 30 years in Ethiopia and Rwanda, the population rose by almost 80% (Ethiopia from 62 to 108 million, Rwanda from 7 to 12.5 million). Across Africa, there was a 20% growth in internet users in 2017 alone. This signifies a growing, increasingly connected workforce, which creates great opportunity for outsourcing and partnership.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The world has a scarcity of software developers. Meanwhile, Africa has a growing young population. Training software developers in Africa, who US and European firms can hire, taps into that human capital.”<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-41899173" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-41899173" target="_blank">BBC, Jan 2018.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Africa is leap-frogging in terms of tech innovation. Several <a href="https://newafricanmagazine.com/news-analysis/development/10-new-innovations-key-to-africa-and-they-are-all-made-by-africans/" target="_blank">key African innovations</a> in mobile technology, sustainability, off-grid energy, and digital payment systems are leading the way. In contrast, economies like the US, UK, and Japan deal with legacy systems that delay progress. Free and open source software is an important part of that progress in Africa.</p>
<h3>When Open Source Communities Reach out, Their Adoption Grows</h3>
<p>If you look across the markets and the communities of programmers in Africa, we see many of them embracing WordPress and Joomla. This may have stemmed from two factors. Firstly, the easy learning curve of these CMSs have made it easy for young developers to set up websites for local businesses and entrepreneurs. Furthermore, the Joomla Foundation and Automattic have taken an active role in sponsoring tech events in Africa like the CMS Africa Summit.</p>
<p>With such huge opportunity ahead, it was time for the TYPO3 Association to get involved.</p>
<p>The TYPO3 community had representation at the event in 2014 and again in 2018 at the Summit held in Kigali, Rwanda. The presentation Daniel Homorodean gave sparked a lot of interest. Follow up meetings and in-depth discussions with the Rwandan government followed, which lead to the TYPO3 Association sending another delegation to visit in December. The Rwandan government became convinced that TYPO3 was the right choice for a critical project for government institutions. One again, it was proven to be the best solution for serving multiple websites using one powerful CMS. What’s more, they wanted to create capacity locally, training both developers and content managers to support the project. The TYPO3 Association remains a strong ally for the Rwandans to continue into this direction.</p>
<p>In 2019 TYPO3 got involved on a larger scale, as one of the main sponsors of the CMS Africa Summit held in Cape Town, South Africa between 15-16 March. The Association sent four attendees, including the President of the Association, Olivier Dobberkau, and the CEO of TYPO3 Gmbh, Mathias Schreiber. We had a full-stacked stand, and plenty of brochures and giveaways. We got to meet many people from across the continent.</p>
<p>In Cape Town, the TYPO3 delegation engaged in discussions with people from South Africa, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Congo, Uganda and Nigeria. Talks by Mathias and Jurian Janssen were received with great interest. They showcased TYPO3 as the CMS of choice for projects requiring scalability, security, performance and extensibility. TYPO3 was also shown to be a great fit for large projects for corporations or institutions requiring multi-language support, complex editorial workflows, multidomain instances, such as universities, ministries, or city halls.</p>
<p>We were proud to emphasize these complex features, which make TYPO3 unique compared to other CMSs well-represented at the summit.</p>
<h3>Growing TYPO3 in Africa with Stronger Connections and Education</h3>
<p>As you have read, the interest generated around TYPO3 during the summit among attendees, programmers and management is already converting into ongoing conversations that show TYPO3 has potential to grow. We look forward to seeing more local agencies learning about TYPO3, testing it in pilot projects, and using it more and more in their local markets.</p>
<p>As we saw in Rwanda, we see potential for connecting to larger institutions and building a long-term plan to build capacity and grow local support. The result would be a lasting impact on the market and long-term partnerships.</p>
<p>At the current pace of growth, Africa needs more programmers, much more than even the local universities can generate. To meet the needs, many alternative education initiatives that help young people to learn programming are gaining traction.</p>
<p>In Cape Town, we visited some of the local initiatives and discussed ideas with others during the Summit. This was inspiring. We considered: what if we had TYPO3 Schools, providing training for young programmers and developers? We came back with contacts and ideas that could help create awareness and build TYPO3 skills in a totally new community. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s an exciting time in Africa. The next generation of developers and entrepreneurs in leadership positions in Africa have a fresh vision. They have innovative ideas, better access to funding, and new potential in their local economies. Startup communities are forming in cities like Nairobi, Kampala, Lagos, Accra, Kigali or Cape Town, and the IT industry to support them is flourishing.</p>
<p>The technology to support those businesses, along with improving skills and knowledge, will help these businesses grow. Giving new developers the knowledge and experience to use TYPO3 not only helps them earn more money and get jobs locally, it also connects them and the businesses they work for to virtually any market in the world.</p>
<p>Content management systems like TYPO3 are an important part of many businesses. Whether it’s the public face of a company that spans across multiple languages and locations in Africa,or &nbsp;a business-critical application that offers integration with new systems, a tool like TYPO3 CMS gives these creative communities the flexibility to get the job done. As a tool that excels at multisite, multilingual projects and integrates so well with other platforms, TYPO3 can help entrepreneurs in Africa connect across borders, languages, and traditions.</p>
<h3>What’s next? Come to CMS Africa Summit 2020 in Accra, Ghana</h3>
<p>TYPO3’s relationship with Africa is only just beginning. We see a fantastic opportunity ahead of us. Africa will continue to see strong growth, and the tech community is eager to embrace the best technologies. TYPO3 CMS should be there in the front row.</p>
<p>Next year the CMS Africa Summit will take place in Accra, Ghana. And the TYPO3 community will be in strong attendance. Meanwhile, all the connections that have been made so far are the beginnings of bridges. We can help enable local projects and agencies to adopt TYPO3, and at the same time help TYPO3 grow globally.</p>

						<title>Recap of the combined sprint of TYPO3.org and Server Team</title>
						<link>https://typo3.org/article/recap-of-the-combined-sprint-of-typo3org-and-server-team/</link>
						<description>Report of combined sprint of TYPO3.org and Server Team in Stuttgart, May 2019.</description>
						<enclosure url="https://typo3.org/fileadmin/t3o_common_storage/news/2019/05/2019-05-22-Combined-Sprint-Stuttgart-Team.jpg" length="3832329" type="image/jpeg" />
						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In May 2019 the TYPO3.org and server teams joined for a combined sprint in Stuttgart (Germany). The sprint took place on May 19-22, 2019 at AmedickSommer GmbH (<a href="http://www.amedick-sommer.de" target="_blank">http://www.amedick-sommer.de</a>). We were 8 people on &nbsp;the sprint and most of the attendees already arrived on Sunday, so that we could start early on Monday. Benni Mack, TYPO3 Project Lead, joined us on two days. Below we like to give you an overview of the results that were created during the four days:</p>
<h2>Server Team</h2>
<h3>Gerrit migration to Docker</h3>
<p>In our ongoing effort to overcome Chef issues and use standardized setups of tools, Stephan Großberndt not only managed to upgrade our Gerrit installation but also did a migration to Docker. The Gerrite service (<a href="https://review.typo3.org" target="_blank">https://review.typo3.org</a>) is now running as a container which makes maintainability easier.</p>
<h3>Attempt to block DoS attacks</h3>
<p>In the last months the TYPO3 infrastructure suffered from some DoS attacks. We analyzed the recent outages of our Git service and took measures to adress those attacks and provide stable services for our users. Michael Stucki and Andri Steiner implemented this on our infrastructure.</p>
<h3>Squashing tickets</h3>
<p>Sprints are a perfect opportunity to jointly work on ticktes, either in Forge or OTRS, and get things done – and queues empty. Therefore we were able to resolve some issues and close tickets as well as answer some support requests. We also cleaned up our inventory and remove some outdated and unused hosts. To reduce the amount of ticket Spam, Andri implemented Spam Filter Learning from the OTRS Spam Queue. Also, we managed to update our backup server as well as the DNS server to Debian 9. Andi also implemented first team categories and an announcement mirror for talk.typo3.org and we discussed further proceedings with the announce mailinglist.</p>
<h3>LDAP Migration to Docker</h3>
<p>On request of the TYPO3.org team and inspired by Stephan's work, Andreas Beutel startet the migration of the TYPO3 LDAP Server into a Docker container that could be easily set up and populated with dummy data to allow local development for my.typo3.org and TYPO3.org accounts.</p>
<h2>TYPO3.org Team</h2>
<h3>Upgrade my.typo3.org to TYPO3 CMS v9-LTS</h3>
<p>The upgrade to v9 went without big issues. Now, the second of four websites runs with the latest LTS version of TYPO3. Next goal is to upgrade TER to v9.</p>
<h3>Update of DDEV to 1.8.0</h3>
<p>All of the 4 instances were updated to ddev 1.8.0 and tested.</p>
<h2>Closing words</h2>
<p>A team sprint is not only about creating results. For each one of us, it has been opportunity to learn new stuff, have interesting discussions and enjoy delicious Burgers :-) In short, it's a great chance to get some new motivation for the (sometimes) more boring time between two sprints. That being said, we hope to see even more new contributors at one of the next sprints. If you are interested to join, just contact us any time on the TYPO3 Slack community in the #t3o-team and #typo3-server-team channels.</p>
<h2>Next Sprint</h2>
<p>Another joint sprint is planned to follow in August 2019. Prior to this, the next sprints will be held by each one of the teams separately. In general, you can find information about upcoming team sprints on the events page on typo3.org.</p>
<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>We like to thank AmedickSommer GmbH for being our host during 4 days. Many thanks to the members of the TYPO3 Association who are covering all travel and accommodation costs through their membership.&nbsp;Participants of the sprint: Andreas Beutel, Bastian Bringenberg, Stefan Busemann, Stephan Großberndt, Thomas Löffler, Andreas Nedbal, Andri Steiner, Michael Stucki.</p>]]></content:encoded>

						<title>Join Us at the Fluid 3.0 Workshop in Denmark</title>
						<link>https://typo3.org/article/join-us-at-the-fluid-30-workshop-in-denmark/</link>
						<description>Join the mission to prepare Fluid version 3.0, help us improve documentation—and enjoy a couple of days in beautiful Denmark.</description>
						<enclosure url="https://typo3.org/fileadmin/t3o_common_storage/news/2019/05/https---cdn.evbuc.com-images-62309544-307814575964-1-original.20190515-091846.jpeg" length="37934" type="image/jpeg" />
						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fluid-30-workshop-in-denmark-registration-61921868977" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary">Register for the Workshop</a></p>
<h2>Date and Location</h2>
<p>You are invited to <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fluid-30-workshop-in-denmark-registration-61921868977" target="_blank">join the Fluid 3.0 workshop in Aarhus, Denmark, 20–22 June</a>, where <a href="https://systime.dk/" target="_blank">Systime</a> will host a TYPO3 event once again.</p>
<h2>About the Event</h2>
<p>The focus of the workshop is:</p>
<ul> 	<li> 	<p><strong>Convert all source code to PHP 7.2 minimum</strong> and implement strict types. This is why the name of the workshop is Fluid 3.0, as this conversion is the basis for the next major release.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong>A major refactoring of the internal components</strong> to unify Fluid’s patterns. Fluid is using a variety of classes to do very similar things. The goal of this task is to unify these into a smaller set of more generic components that are able to perform all the current tasks in Fluid, and much more.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong>Improvements for documentation and documentation generating.</strong> First of all, Fluid needs better, dedicated documentation and new documentation is required for the new capabilities added by the refactoring of Fluid’s internal components. Secondly, Fluid is capable of automatically generating documentation in the form of XSD files and being in the same location provides us with a great opportunity to improve this feature to work better with the way documentation is presented on the TYPO3 web site.</p> 	</li> </ul>
<h2>Sharing Knowledge About Fluid’s Internal Components</h2>
<p>The refactoring that will take place is the ideal opportunity to learn more about not just how Fluid does things in current versions, but also learn how the refactored API will work and how it can be extended.</p>
<p>This means that we are mostly looking for the following types of people to join:</p>
<ol> 	<li> 	<p><strong>Developers comfortable with PHP 7.2</strong> strict types and refactoring and who are interested in developing the new and improved internal API of Fluid.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong>Non-developers with writing skills (English)</strong> and a desire to help improve the user-facing documentation for Fluid.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong>Anyone involved in the current documentation process in TYPO3</strong> who wants to help guide the effort to improve Fluid’s documentation with a shared vision.</p> 	</li> </ol>
<p>There will be two tracks:</p>
<ol> 	<li> 	<p><strong>Track One:</strong> Type strictness and refactoring on one side,</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong>Track Two:</strong> Documentation on the other.</p> 	</li> </ol>
<p>Towards the end, the two tracks will converge to discuss and improve Fluid’s automated documentation capabilities.</p>
<h2>Workshop Agenda</h2>
<ul> 	<li> 	<p>Doors open on 20 June 08:00.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>09:00 short introduction of the workshop.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>Doors close again on 22 June around 15:00.</p> 	</li> </ul>
<p>Other than this there is no fixed schedule.</p>
<h2>Travel and Accommodation</h2>
<ul> 	<li> 	<p>Lunch will be provided all three days but dinner is only provided on the 20th and 21st.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>It will be possible to stay late evenings (and there may, just may, be served some beer brewed by Claus on Friday evening).</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>Hotel and travel costs can be reimbursed. Naturally there will be coffee and snacks enough to keep a small town awake and snacking for three days.</p> 	</li> </ul>
<p>There is room in the budget for approximately 15 participants, but physical room for more who wish to participate without reimbursement. We may reschedule to a later time if we are unable to gather enough participants.</p>
<h2>Register and Tell Us a Bit About Yourself</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fluid-30-workshop-in-denmark-registration-61921868977" target="_blank">If you want to join us—and I hope you do—please add a tiny bit about yourself in the message field</a>, such as which track you would like to join (or both!) and whether or not you will need reimbursement for travel and hotel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /> Hope to see you there,</p>
<p>Claus Due, the Fluid guy.</p>

						<title>Event Report from TYPO3 Camp Vienna</title>
						<link>https://typo3.org/article/event-report-from-typo3-camp-vienna/</link>
						<description>Earlier this month TYPO3 community members gathered at TYPO3 Camp Vienna for a weekend of learning, connecting, and camaraderie. </description>
						<enclosure url="https://typo3.org/fileadmin/t3o_common_storage/news/2019/05/Susi.jpg" length="1402457" type="image/jpeg" />
						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In-person events are useful for both new or existing community members. You can meet the people you see online and create connections that support continued remote work. Attending events like TYPO3 Camp Vienna and TYPO3 Camp Mitteldeutschland has given me a head start when interacting with the community online, thanks to established relationships and shared experiences that we can build on to create great things for the TYPO3 project.</p>
<p><a href="/community/events/" class="btn btn-primary">Check Out Upcoming TYPO3 Events</a></p>
<h2>Sessions at TYPO3 Camp Vienna</h2>
<p>TYPO3 Camp Vienna is one of a handful of community events that are primarily conducted in English, which is a huge benefit for those who love TYPO3 but don’t speak German, including myself. I was very grateful to the presenters and attendees in Vienna who were willing and able to switch to English for myself and other non-German speakers. I appreciate the extra effort that takes, especially as my goals in attending these events include research and understanding to support a new English TYPO3 Guidebook! More on that in a minute.</p>
<p>Truly, the best part of an event is meeting people, and there were many of you who took some time to connect and chat. Thank you especially to the organizers from <a href="https://www.supseven.at/" target="_blank">supseven</a>, Attila János and Kathrin Schütte, who remembered me from our emails when I walked in to register on the first day.</p>
<h3>Keynote Speech</h3>
<p>Susi Moog gave the event a strong start with her keynote address about the power of knowing you have a community of people supporting you. We’re all in this together when it comes to figuring out hard problems, building new things, or organizing educational and contribution events. Even when we’re not together every day we can draw strength from the knowledge that others are there to work with you and share their own know-how and experience to help us all move forward and succeed.</p>
<h3>Intro to TYPO3 Documentation</h3>
<p>Then, Daniel Siepmann explained how to contribute to TYPO3 documentation, saying that every contribution helps and that the effort picks up steam once you’ve added your first few fixes. You can <a href="https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/HowToDocument/latest/WritingDocsOfficial/" target="_blank">get started by clicking the “Edit me on GitHub” link on any documentation page</a>. Daniel also showed us how to use reStructuredText (RST) in more complex documentation situations and mentioned that the <a href="/community/teams/documentation/">documentation team</a> can always use more dedicated support as there is a lot to do. Drop by the <a href="https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/HowToDocument/latest/HowToGetHelp.html#how-to-get-help" target="_blank">#typo3-documentation Slack channel</a> with your questions and contributions.</p>
<h3>Google Ads Integration</h3>
<p>We had a visit from Christoph Schier of Google, who helped introduce the <a href="https://typo3.com/blog/create-and-manage-google-ads-directly-in-your-cms" target="_blank">new Google Ads integration</a> from TYPO3 GmbH with Stefan Schreiber. It was really neat to see this functionality in action, and major kudos to Anja Leichsenring and the team at TYPO3 GmbH for their work on building the middleware involved! This work helped to eliminate hurdles to integration and adoption and paved the way for future endeavors both for TYPO3 users and even beyond into the greater web community.</p>
<h3>Growing your TYPO3 Skillset</h3>
<p>Florian Weiss gave several very helpful sessions based on his work with <a href="https://www.skilldisplay.eu/" target="_blank">SkillDisplay</a>, including what’s new for editors in TYPO3 v9. The idea behind SkillDisplay is that users can follow skill paths and build on their existing skills in TYPO3. Knowledge is cumulative, and as you add one small addition at a time you’ll find yourself becoming more of an expert than you might realize. Florian also presented the “Mainzific Rim” gamification of learning TYPO3, which provides a simple context for editors especially to get started making small changes and understanding what’s available. Personally, this is on my list to try out right away, being as how there were dinosaurs and all…</p>
<p>I talked with Florian about how we can work together to combine the efforts of the TYPO3 <a href="/community/teams/education-certification/">education committee</a> and SkillDisplay with my own research to build an introductory guide to TYPO3 for newcomers. Part of the joy of open source is that we can combine efforts and learning to build stronger projects with each other’s support.</p>
<h3>TYPO3 Book Project</h3>
<p>Finally, I presented a progress report on our <a href="https://www.typo3book.com/blog/first-blog-post" target="_blank">TYPO3 book project</a>! Thank you to everyone who attended and submitted comments on the draft chapter we shared. The idea behind the book is that we reach a variety of people who are new to TYPO3, be it clients, agencies, developers, editors and anyone else. We explain what TYPO3 is and what it’s good for before launching those users into existing documentation. We present good practices for how to approach development and use of TYPO3, as well as an explanatory introduction to TYPO3 without simply repeating existing materials. It’s only right that our TYPO3 book should be a somewhat open source project itself, and we’re grateful to the community for any feedback, contributions, and support we recieve.</p>
<h2>See You Soon...</h2>
<p>Attending TYPO3 Camps is validating, invigorating, and extremely useful for quickly expanding not just your knowledge and experience but also your connection to others who have even more knowledge and experience. Face-to-face time is critical especially for community members who work remotely and who are distributed across cities and time zones. Gathering together matches faces to names and context to conversations that we have online. We hope to see you all at an upcoming event like <a href="https://t3dd19.typo3.com/" target="_blank">TYPO3 Dev Days</a> in August!</p>

						<title>Recap: Docs Team Joins typo3.org Sprint Wiesbaden</title>
						<link>https://typo3.org/article/recap-docs-team-joins-typo3org-sprint-wiesbaden/</link>
						<description>The Documentation Team joined the typo3.org Team Sprint in Wiesbaden, Germany from Feb 10-13. Two of us from the Docs team met up for the sprint,  Daniel Siepmann, of Codappix GmbH, and myself, Sybille Peters, from Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg.</description>
						<enclosure url="https://typo3.org/fileadmin/t3o_common_storage/news/2019/05/aoe_office_conference_room_1280_720.jpg" length="114272" type="image/jpeg" />
						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our plan was to work on documentation topics, but also take the chance of talking with typo3.org (t3o) team members about what issues we have in common. After all, both teams work on making information available to the TYPO3 community so there was bound to be some overlap.</p>
<p>You can read what they accomplished in the <a href="/article/report-on-the-typo3org-team-sprint-in-wiesbaden-feb-2019/">Report on the typo3.org Team Sprint here</a>.</p>
<p>The sprint was hosted by <a href="https://www.aoe.com/" target="_blank">AOE GmbH</a> at their offices in Wiesbaden. This was a very nice location for the sprint with a separate room for discussions. It seemed like the hosts had thought of everything. Even earplugs were available, which was not a bad idea because some heated debates did occur.</p>
<p>The working atmosphere was very productive with standups twice daily and we made some progress on ongoing tasks:</p>
<h2>Tasks</h2>
<h3>Tooling and Workflow</h3>
<ul> 	<li> 	<p>Automatic rendering of ViewHelper reference from source code comments</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>Optimized workflow for rendering on documentation server</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>Began optimizing toolchain for t3docs theme</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>Worked on issues and pull requests for t3docs theme (max-width, version selector)</p> 	</li> </ul>
<h3>New Documentation Published and Improved</h3>
<ul> 	<li> 	<p>Finalized rte_ckeditor documentation and announced on <a href="https://docs.typo3.org/" target="_blank">docs.typo3.org</a> (completed)</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>Optimized documentation on rendering documentation locally with Docker (completed)</p> 	</li> </ul>
<h3>Planning and Strategy</h3>
<ul> 	<li> 	<p>Began brainstorming on new start page for <a href="https://docs.typo3.org/" target="_blank">docs.typo3.org</a></p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>Discussed ideas for making it easier for people new to TYPO3 (What documentation do they need? How do they find it?)</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>Collected feedback from other team members</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>Joined discussion initiated by Stefan Busemann on general communication strategy</p> 	</li> </ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>TYPO3 sprints with multiple teams are a great idea. We are looking forward to joining more sprints - with or without other teams. Thank the t3o team and AOE for making this possible!</p>
<p>We are very pleased that two more people expressed an interest in joining the team or contributing regularly.</p>
<p>Now, we are hoping, that even more people will contribute to the documentation. There are cool tasks and endless possibilities to contribute waiting for them, some of which don’t even involve writing! Keep an eye on the <a href="https://typo3.org/community/events/typo3-sprint/all/" target="_blank">list of upcoming sprints</a> to see what is happening next.</p>
<h2>Join Us?</h2>
<p>We haven’t planned the next documentation sprint yet, but you can join us in the Slack channel #typo3-documentation.</p>
<p>Please spread the word that <a href="https://typo3.com/blog/start-improving-docs-now-to-grow-typo3" target="_blank">everyone can contribute to TYPO3 documentation</a>, and everyone in the community has skills to help improve documentation.</p>
<p>There are a number of tasks you might be able to help out on that need help. If you are a developer and don’t like writing documentation - there are things you can help us with as well. Just contact us!</p>

						<title>Teamleader Meeting March / April 2019</title>
						<link>https://typo3.org/article/teamleader-meeting-march-april-2019/</link>
						<description>The leaders of the official teams and committees of the TYPO3 projects met to their monthly meeting. Highlight was a workshop, to improve communication. 

Once in a month our leaders met in an online meeting, to coordinate all efforts for our project. In March and April we had two meetings. One regular online meeting and one real life meeting in Leipzig.
</description>
						
						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Combined Sprints</strong></p>
<p>In 2019 we introduced the new format of “combined sprints”. In our meeting, we made a planning for sprints:</p>
<ul> 	<li>Team Leader Meeting (Leipzig)&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Sprint 1: Stuttgart -&nbsp;19.5 - 22.5.2019 (lead by t3o-team)</li> 	<li>Sprint 2: Freiburg -&nbsp;12.8 -&nbsp;14.8.2019 - &nbsp; (lead by marketing team) - up to 20 persons</li> 	<li>Sprint 3: 22.09. -25.09.2019 - Hof (lead by t3o-team) - up to&nbsp;20 persons</li> 	<li>Sprint 4: Düsseldorf October 2019 - up to&nbsp;15 Persons</li> 	<li>Sprint 5: 03.11. - 6.11.2019 - Essen (lead by t3o-team) - up to15 persons</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Sub Brand Concept</strong></p>
<p>Our design team works at a concept for sub brands. We had discussion, what kind of Logo definitions we need. We want to introduce a common logo / brand concept for our different events / sites. The current draft was presented and the team will continue its work.</p>
<p><strong>Policy for team leader / teams / committees</strong></p>
<p>The TYPO3 Association and the team leaders want to introduce a policy for teams and its leards. What are the goals of our policy:</p>
<ul> 	<li>Clear definition of responsibilities</li> 	<li>Clear processes, how empower / depower a team / committee</li> 	<li>Clear rights and duties</li> 	<li>Clear lines of communication</li> 	<li>A transparent organisation</li> 	<li>Commitment to contribution</li> </ul>
<p>We will present the current state in an own news.</p>
<p><strong>Communication concept</strong><br /> The project maintains different communication channels and with different tools. We started a process, where we want to identify, what are the needs for the channels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to mention one aspect: We introduced Slack very successful some years ago. Our community likes to use this tool and this replaces more or less mailing list functionality. The downside is, that we are loosing visibility of support questions in the public web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, we are checking all our communication channels and try to find channels and tools for the future.</p>
<p><strong>Core Team Update</strong></p>
<p>Benni Mack gave an update on the result of the new structure:</p>
<ul> 	<li>New Team Structure launched, about 20 applications arrived</li> 	<li>Fluid Standalone =&gt; &quot;Fluid Templating Engine&quot; and a 3.0 release is planned in this year, also we'll publish a roadmap for Fluid Engine. Claus Due will be the main contact person.</li> 	<li>Initiatives have their own roadmap, as it's not in power of the Core Team to promise finalization</li> 	<li>News for Core Roadmap was published</li> 	<li>10.0 is planned for late July, 10 LTS is planned for April 8th, 2020</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Team Leader meeting in Leipzig</strong><br /> In the beforehand of our General Assembly, the team leaders met at monday night for a special event. We invited two actors for “Unternehmen Bühne”. Here we were given playful exercises to improve our communication behaviour.</p>
<p>At Tuesday Morning we made a workshop, to identify priorities for combined team approaches.</p>
<p>We collected a list of items, which are problems in the collaboration between the Teams and Community in General. These were the most important ones:</p>
<ul> 	<li>Unclear Contact Persons &nbsp;(10 votes): It is necessary, to provide transparency for who is responsible for what and how to contact that person</li> 	<li>Unclear Contact Channels (10 votes): Which is the right channel to contact a team / person</li> 	<li>Regular public communication (7 votes)</li> 	<li>Handover process between “inter-team tasks” (who place the order) (8 votes)</li> </ul>
<p>The next step is, to create action points and solve each issue.</p>
<p>In General our team communication is improving, month by month. We do have regular team leader meetings for more than a year now.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>
