Introduction
============

In this repository the TYPO3 Dashboard initiative will create a proof of concept of a Dashboard extension for TYPO3.
When the extension is production ready, we will move this extension to TYPO3 core.

Please check the page of the TYPO3 Dashboard initiative to see the goals of the initiative.

What does it do?
================

How to inform an user about important updates regarding the website?

More and more people are asking for a dashboard to have the possibility to easily find important information.
This initiative will focus on creating a dashboard for TYPO3 that is flexible and really integrated in the backend of TYPO3.

The focus is not only on editors.

Also integrators and administrators will have easy access to the most important information.

Last but not least, also developers will benefit from the dashboard.
It will be easy to add an own dataset to a widget so developers can show specific information to a user or even ship complete dashboards.
